# Power Apps

## Student Digital Leader Power App - Calendar

The calendar power app is a basic Power App frame with calendar functionality while being attached to a SharePoint List. While it is tailored for the project I worked on as a Student Digital Leader for Durham University, it has basic elements which can be used as a basis for any Power App Calendar. 

### Features
- Event creation pop up.
- Functionality for editing and deleting events, in app.
- Easily move through months and years.
- Colour code events based off event type.

## Support Request App

The support request app is a tracking app for support requests received to project members over the course of the project I worked on at Durham University. It allows basic data entry and filtering for requests which are stored on a SharePoint List.

## Webinar FAQs 

This Power App was used by members of the project team to quickly enter in FAQs that were mentioned in the webinars we ran as a project. This app then stored them in a list and allowed them to be viewed and updated.
