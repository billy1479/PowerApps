# Power Apps

## Student Digital Leader Power App - Calendar

The calendar power app is a basic Power App frame with calendar functionality while being attached to a SharePoint List. While it is tailored for the project I worked on as a Student Digital Leader for Durham University, it has basic elements which can be used as a basis for any Power App Calendar. 

### Features
- Event creation pop up.
- Functionality for editing and deleting events, in app.
- Easily move through months and years.
- Colour code events based off event type.
