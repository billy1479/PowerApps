# Power Apps

## Durham University Power App - Calendar

The calendar power app is a basic Power App frame with calendar functionality while being attached to a SharePoint List. While it is tailored for the project I worked on as a Student Digital Leader for Durham University, it has basic elements which can be used as a basis for any Power App Calendar. 

### Features
- Event creation pop up.
- Functionality for editing and deleting events, in app.
- Easily move through months and years.
- Colour code events based off event type.

## ArdenIT Ltd Power App - Calendar

This calendar Power App is similar to the one for Durham University with some extra functionality, like a different calendar board just for the current week. 

## Job Sheets Power App

This Power App was an upgrade to the legacy system I made for ArdenIT Ltd. The legacy system allowed job sheets to be created following site visits, store the results in an SQL database and email the details to the expenses team. 

The Power App edition allowed for an ease of use for engineers by granting easier UI customisation. Also, it integrated better with 365 tenant details and allowed data to be stored in SharePoint Lists. Power Automate flows are required with this app in order for it to work. 

### Features
- Data entry
- File upload
- Person column
- Linked to flows
- PDF creation
- Emailing

## Support Request App

The support request app is a tracking app for support requests received to project members over the course of the project I worked on at Durham University. It allows basic data entry and filtering for requests which are stored on a SharePoint List. 

### Features
- Data entry with various list column types
- Person column use
- Filtering of list items based off column values

## Webinar FAQs 

This Power App was used by members of the project team to quickly enter in FAQs that were mentioned in the webinars we ran as a project. This app then stored them in a list and allowed them to be viewed and updated. 

### Features
- Data entry
- Filtering
